Ceasar-cipher.
My first project just to practice my skills in Python and Git also.
The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each character in the plaintext is replaced by a character that is at some constant number of positions to the left or right of it in the alphabet. This constant position is called the key. All you have to do is wtite a sentence you want to cipher and a key on which position you want to move the character in the alphabet.
You can ciper and decipher any sentence you want throught the Ceasar-cipher.
Enjoy!
